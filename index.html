  Welcome! This page is dedicated to an exciting experiment we are conducting at IIT Kanpur. The way it works is simple - we give you a Firefox 
  web extension which just needs to be installed on Firefox browser! That's pretty much it actually. You need to continue normal browsing 
  and after about a month or so, we will get in touch with you and ask for your browsing logs, which can be generated easily with the web extension.
