  Welcome! This page is dedicated to an exciting experiment we are conducting at the Department of Computer Science, IIT Kanpur. 
  
  We intend to study the behavior of people on the internet and in particular how simple UI manipulations cause changes in the exploratory web-browsing of internet users. We have designed a web extension that alters the New Tab display of the Firefox browser. We need participants 
  who would volunteer to use our web extension for a month. The entire exercise is passive - all that we ask of you is to continue normal 
  web-browsing after installing the extension. Also, it is completely safe! There is no direct transfer of any information from your web-browser
  to a remote server. Everything is logged and stored in your local machine.
  
  
  The way it works is simple - we give you a Firefox 
  web extension which needs to be installed on the Firefox browser (Version 56 or above)! That's pretty much it actually. You need to continue normal browsing 
  and after about a month or so, we will get in touch with you and ask for your browsing logs, which can be generated easily with the web extension.
  
  The steps for installing the extension are as follows - 
  
   <ul>
  <li>Open Mozilla Firefox and select Add-ons from the pull down menu at the upper right corner or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+A</li>
  <li>Now, in the upper right corner of the Add-ons screen, click on the 'Settings' option </li>
  <li>In the pull-down menu which appears, select 'Install Add-on from file' and select the file we sent you</li>
</ul> 
  The steps for downloading the log files are as follows -
  <ul>
  <li>Open Mozilla Firefox and in the upper right corner of the screen click on the red icon of the web-extension</li>
  <li>Now, click once on the option 'Download Console Log' </li>
  <li>Finally save the file, look at its contents, remove anything 'objectionable' and send us the file </li>
</ul>
