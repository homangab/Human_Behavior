    The internet was meant to be a place where information was free, and the only limit to exploration was the span of our own curiosity.

<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles">filter bubble</a> - a state of intellectual isolation where all we ever see is content and people that we already know and like. This blandness is created algorithmically by internet companies who want to maximize the time we spend on their services, and so use our previous browsing history to recommend content that is similar.

  <p>
A grave concern is that, as algorithms learn to pinpoint our behavior better, they will trap us in cycles of behavior that reinforce our strongest prejudices, leaving little mental space open for curiosity and exploration.  </p>

 Do you want to know how strong your filter bubble is when you browse the web, and help us understand the formation of filter bubbles at the same time?  </p>
