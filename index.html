  'If you only see posts from folks who are like you, youâ€™re going to be surprised when someone very unlike you wins the presidency'
   </p>
  <p>
    This quote is by Eli Pariser, the internet activist who blessed the world with his idea of a filter bubble. It is a state of intellectual
    isolation caused by 'personalized searches' that is incresingly being enforced by various online agencies (websites, social media, search engines)
    today. This leads to a reinforcing of previously observed behavior resulting in people being separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoint
    and ultimately being 'trapped' in an 'ideological bubble'. 
  </p>
  
  <p> The great philosopher Aristotle, whom we all love to quote and seek advice from once said that we become what we habitually do. The present day internet
    is a mad house with various platforms being released everyday, people delving into all sorts of addictions and various mass revolutions
    being orchestrated online. We are often unaware of why we do what we do, how long we do it and what are its repurcussions. Do you want to know what you habitually 
    do when you browse the web, and help us understand how to combat internet addiction at the same time?
