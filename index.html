  Welcome! This page is dedicated to an exciting experiment we are conducting at the Department of Computer Science, IIT Kanpur. 
  </p>
   <p>
  We intend to study the behavior of people on the internet and in particular how simple UI manipulations cause changes in the exploratory web-browsing of internet users. We have designed a web extension that alters the New Tab display of the Firefox browser. We need participants 
  who would volunteer to use our web extension for a month. The entire exercise is passive - all that we ask of you is to continue normal 
  web-browsing after installing the extension. Also, it is completely safe! There is no direct transfer of any information from your web-browser
  to a remote server. Everything is logged and stored in your local machine.
   </p>
   <p>
  The way it works is simple - we give you a Firefox 
  web extension which needs to be installed on the Firefox browser (Version 56 or above)! That's pretty much it actually. You need to continue normal browsing 
  and after about a month or so, we will get in touch with you and ask for your browsing logs, which can be generated easily with the web extension.
   </p>
  
   <p>
  The steps for installing the extension are as follows - 
  
   <ul>
   <li>Open Mozilla Firefox and select Add-ons from the pull down menu at the upper right corner or use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+A</li>
  <li>Now, in the upper right corner of the Add-ons screen, click on the 'Settings' option </li>
  <li>In the pull-down menu which appears, select 'Install Add-on from file' and select the file we sent you</li>
</ul> 
  
   </p>
   <p>
  The steps for downloading the log files are as follows -
  <ul>
  <li>Open Mozilla Firefox and in the upper right corner of the screen click on the red icon of the web-extension</li>
  <li>Now, click once on the option 'Download Console Log' </li>
  <li>Finally save the file, look at its contents, remove anything 'objectionable' and send us the file </li>
</ul>
