  We have designed a web extension that makes minor modifications to your
  browser's UI from time to time. We would like you to volunteer to use this extension for a month. All you'd need to 
  do is install the extension and browse as you always do.
  </p>
  <p>
The extension will not (repeat, not) collect your browsing data. The extension is digitally watermarked by Mozilla and hence is certified safe (Please note
    that without digital watermarking, a web extension cannot run on the official Firefox browser)
  At the end of the month, the extension will show you your logged webpages and ask you to curate this list to remove 
  any pages that you wish to keep private. We'd ask you, at that point, to upload this curated log file to our web service.
  </p>
    
    <p>
We will use the data you share with us to give you a personalized visual tour of your typical browsing behavior,
  including most frequent site transitions, time-of-day statistics and the diversity of your information diet in 
      comparison with other participants in our experiment.
